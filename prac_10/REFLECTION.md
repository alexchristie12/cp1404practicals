# CP1404 Practicals Reflection

**Question 1:** Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy improve during the course of
the subject?

**Answer 1:** When I had first begun the time estimates, I had overestimated the time it would take me to do tasks quite
significantly. Over the course of the subject, I had found that my estimates got much closer to the actual time it took
me to complete tasks. From being 5 minutes too fast on smaller projects to being within 1 or 2 minutes. And on larger
exercises I was usually out by 15-20 minutes, now I am more within 5-10 minutes.

**Question 2:** Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews>?

**Answer 2:** I have gleaned alot of very useful skills and learned a lot of valuable lessons during the code reviews in
CP1404. By reading and giving feedback for other peoples code that I had not written and that I didn't have knowledge of
allowed me to improve my own self reviewing process and has allowed me to pick up on issues more quickly and
effectively.

**Question 3:** Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

**Answer 3:** Overall I was very happy with the practicals for CP1404, there isn't really anything that I would change.

Throughout the course of CP1404 there are a few code reviews that I feel I did really well:
[The code review for Prac 7](https://github.com/JoshuaDelosSantos/cp1404practicals/pull/4#event-10863901955) that I did 
for `JoshuaDelosSantos` I feel was really well done. Not only do I feel that my code review was good, but the 
communication between Josh and I during the code review was really effective in making a good code review.

[The code review for Prac 5](https://github.com/jackcox343/cp1404practicals/pull/2#event-10730841810) that I did for
`jackcox343`. In this practical I feel that the tone and specific feedback I gave for this review was good.
